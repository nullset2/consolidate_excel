# consolidate_excel
A python script dependant on pandas and numpy that reads n xlsx files in the current directory and lumps them all together in a single CSV volume.

Meant to illustrate an approach for merging lots of excel files in one pass. Useful if your files are too big or if you have an inhuman amount of excel files to join, as you may usually have.

Please remember to have numpy and pandas installed before attempting to run this.
